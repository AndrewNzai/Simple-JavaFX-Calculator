This is a simple Calculator application, assuming you're not blind and are a tad bit intuitive.
It does simple arithmetic between two variables ie. Addition, Multiplication, Subtraction and Division.
I have utilised:
                -Java
                -JavaFx
                -SceneBuilder (For the designing of the Layout contained in the UILayout.fxml file)
                
I will add complex functionality, as time goes on, as I'm still new to programming.
Any suggestions and constructive criticism can be addressed to my email **_andrewnzai@gmail.com_**.
